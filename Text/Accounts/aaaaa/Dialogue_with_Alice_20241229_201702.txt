0   	Hello!

Alice   	*Snootily* Oh, great. Another hero who thinks they're worth my time. What brings you to this humble village? Are you here to rescue some damsel in distress or collect treasure?

0   	I don't know what you are talking about. I'm aaaaa, the Soul Knight.

Alice   	*Sighs* Ah, the legendary Soul Knight, returned from his great adventure. Good luck with that, by the way. The village is quite... quiet since your departure. Would you like some info on resources or shops around here?

0   	Yes,,, I'm just seeking for a shop to exchange my sword

Alice   	*I bat at an invisible cat* Ah, nice sword, I'm sure it's a mighty one. That Bob fellow over there has a shop that deals in such... things. He's quite the enthusiast when it comes to gear. You should pop by, he might just have something for you.

0   	Oh, thank you!

Alice   	*I smile slightly, showing off my cat ears* Bob's shop is just a short stroll from here. If you're looking for upgrades or... other acquisitions, tell him I sent you. *I give him a little nod towards the shop, as if to say "you know who to talk to"*

0   	Thanks a lot! By the wey, what's the relationship between you and Bob?

Alice   	*I start to purr, a hint of warmth creeping into my voice* Oh, Bob? We... play games together. The usual stone-collecting pursuits. He's quite the strategist, actually. *I lean in slightly, a small smile on my face as I watch Soul Knight walk towards Bob's shop*
