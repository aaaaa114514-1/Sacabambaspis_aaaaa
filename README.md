- Menu page locates in a beautiful village ! You can buy different weapons and potions, choose from these weapons and enter the portal to start a battle.
- You will meet npcs here. You may approach them and press **Space** to talk to them (more details in Part **Chat with Npcs** ). 
- You can play in either **single player mode** and **pair mode** ! Just approach the portal by yourself / together with your friend and press **Space** !
- You can try your weapons here **for free** ! No limit for magic and you won't be defeated !

#### Fight

- You play the role **Soul Knight**, and you can press keys to control him/them to move or attack enemies by shooting.

- Your goal is to defeat the enemies and then approach the portal.
- Everyone has **HP** and **MP** of their own. When one's HP gets down to 0 or below, then he is defeated.
- Shooting consumes magic power (MP). When one's MP cannot afford a single shot, then he cannot shoot anymore.
- You can move towards the edge of the screen to move the map in most cases. If you have reached the edge of the map or the other player is at the opposite edge of the screen, you cannot move the map.
- When you have defeated all enemies and both of you (If someone is defeated or it's a single-player game, then one player is also accepted) are beside the portal, you can press **Space** to enter the portal and win !

- Haven't remember the steps above? Don't worry! After you have defeated all enemies, everything you should do is just to follow the tips in the bottom right corner of the screen.

#### Chat with Npcs

- You can enhance your relationship with him/her by chatting.
- You may get **key information**, **effect gain** or **resources** by talking to npcs! The closer your relationship is, the more you may get!
- All your relationship and chat history will be saved and bound to your account.
- Tip: sometimes the npc won't reply instantly, and you may check your network and wait for his/her reply patiently.
